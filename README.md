## About
The Universal Runtime Client interacts with UOR artifacts and is aware of the runtime instruction
embedded in UOR artifacts.

## Development

### Requirements

- `go` version 1.17+

### Build

```
make
./bin/client -h
```
### Test

#### Unit:
```
make test-unit
```

## Basic Usage

### User Workflow

1. Create a directory with artifacts to publish to a registry as an OCI artifact. If the files reference each other, the client will replace the in-content linked files with the content address.
   > WARNING: Currently, only JSON is supported for link replacement.
2. Use the `client build` command to create the output workspace with the rendered content. If the files in the workspace do not contain links to each other, skip this step.
3. Use the `client push` command to publish the workspace to a registry as an OCI artifact.
### Template content in a directory without pushing 
```
# The default workspace is "client-workspace" in the current working directory
client build my-directory --output my-workspace
```

### Push workspace to a registry location
```
client push my-workspace localhost:5000/myartifacts:latest
```

## Getting Started

1. Create a new directory. 
2. Add the content to be uploaded in the directory (can be files of any content types).
3. Create a json doc where the value of each kv pair is the path to each file within the directory. Multiple json docs can be used to create deep graphs, but a graph must only have one root. Multiple json docs in a build directory is for advanced use cases. Most use cases do not need more than one json doc. 

Example json doc:
```
{
    "fish": "fish.jpg",
    "text": "subdir1/file.txt",
    "fish2": "subdir1/fish2.jpg"
}
```
4. Create a dataset-config.yaml outside of the content directory that references the relative paths from within the content directory to each file. Add user defined key value pairs as subkeys to the `annotations`section. Each file should have as many attributes as possible. Multiple files can be referenced by using the `*` wildcard. 

Example dataset-config.yaml:
```
kind: DataSetConfiguration
apiVersion: client.uor-framework.io/v1alpha1
files:
  - file: fish.jpg
    attributes:
      animal: fish
      habitat: ocean
      size: small
      color: blue
  - file: subdir1/file.txt
    attributes:
      fiction: true  
      genre: science fiction
  - file: *.jpg
    attributes:
      custom: customval

```
5. Run the UOR client build command referencing the dataset config, the content directory, and optionally push to a registry location.

```
client build --dsconfig dataset-config.yaml content-dir --push --destination localhost:5000/test/dataset:latest
```

6. Optionally inspect the OCI manifest of the dataset:

curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json" <servername>:<port>/v2/<namespace>/<repo>/manifests/<digest or tag>
