## About

The Universal Runtime Client interacts with UOR artifacts and is aware of the runtime instruction
embedded in UOR artifacts.

To learn more about Universal Runtime visit the UOR Framework website at <https://uor-framework.github.io>.

## Development

### Requirements

- `go` version 1.17+

### Build

```
make
./bin/client -h
```

### Test

#### Unit

```
make test-unit
```

## Basic Usage

### Version

client version

### User Workflow

1. Create a directory with artifacts to publish to a registry as an OCI artifact. If the files reference each other, the client will replace the in-content linked files with the content address.
> WARNING: Currently, only JSON is supported for link replacement.
2. Use the `client build` command to build the workspace as an OCI artifact in build cache `(homedir/.uor)`.
3. Use the `client push` command to publish to a registry as an OCI artifact.
4. Use the `client pull` command to pull the artifact back to a local workspace.

### Build workspace into an artifact

```
client build my-workspace localhost:5000/myartifacts:latest
```

```
# Optionally with dsconfig
client build my-workspace localhost:5000/myartifacts:latest --dsconfig dataset-config.yaml
```
### Push workspace to a registry location

```
client push my-workspace localhost:5000/myartifacts:latest
```

### Pull UOR collection to a location

```
client pull localhost:5000/myartifacts:latest -o my-output-directory
```

### Pull subsets of a UOR collection to a location by attribute

```
client pull localhost:5000/myartifacts:latest -o my-output-directory --attributes key=value
```

## Getting Started

1. Create a new directory.
2. Add the content to be uploaded in the directory (can be files of any content types).
3. Create a json doc where the value of each kv pair is the path to each file within the directory. Multiple json docs can be used to create deep graphs, but a graph must only have one root. Multiple json docs in a build directory is for advanced use cases. Most use cases do not need more than one json doc.

Example json doc:

```
{
    "fish": "fish.jpg",
    "text": "subdir1/file.txt",
    "fish2": "subdir1/fish2.jpg"
}
```

4. Create a dataset-config.yaml outside of the content directory that references the relative paths from within the content directory to each file. Add user defined key value pairs as subkeys to the `annotations`section. Each file should have as many attributes as possible. Multiple files can be referenced by using the `*` wildcard.

Example dataset-config.yaml:

```
kind: DataSetConfiguration
apiVersion: client.uor-framework.io/v1alpha1
files:
  - file: fish.jpg
    attributes:
      animal: fish
      habitat: ocean
      size: small
      color: blue
  - file: subdir1/file.txt
    attributes:
      fiction: true  
      genre: science fiction
  - file: *.jpg
    attributes:
      custom: customval

```

5. Run the UOR client build command referencing the dataset config, the content directory, and the destination registry location.
   ```
client build my-workspace localhost:5000/test/dataset:latest --dsconfig dataset-config.yaml 
```
6. Run the UOR push command to publish
```
client push localhost:5000/test/dataset:latest
```

7. Optionally inspect the OCI manifest of the dataset:
  `curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json" <servername>:<port>/v2/<namespace>/<repo>/manifests/<digest or tag>`

8. Optionally pull the collection back down to verify the content with `client pull`:
  `client pull localhost:5000/test/dataset:latest -o my-output-directory`

9. Optionally pull a subset of the collection back down to verify the content with `client pull`:
  `client pull localhost:5000/test/dataset:latest -o my-output-directory --attributes "fiction=true"`

# Glossary

`collection`: a collection of linked files represented as on OCI artifact
