- [Design: Model](#design-model)


The model package and the sub-package contains all types and methods that can be used to defines and work with UOR data.

- Tree: This structure defines relationship between different UOR node types.
- Iterator: Nodes can be iterable (e.g. a UOR collection). Using the iterator interface allows these structures to be iterated over during tree traversal.
- Matcher: Defines criteria for node searching in a tree or subtree.
