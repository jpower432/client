UOR Client

### Synopsis

The UOR client helps you build, publish, and retrieve UOR collections as an OCI artifact.

 The workflow to publish a collection is to gather files for a collection in a directory workspace and use the build sub-command. During the build process, the tag for the remote destination is specified.

 This build action will store the collection in a build cache. This location can be specified with the UOR_CACHE environment variable. The default location is ~/.uor/cache.

 After the collection has been stored, it can be retrieved and pushed the to registry with the push sub-command.

 Collections can be retrieved from the cache or the remote location (if not stored) with the pull sub-command. The pull sub-command also allows for filtering of the collection with an attribute query configuration file.
